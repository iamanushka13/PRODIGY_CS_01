# PRODIGY_CS_01
# Caesar Cipher in Python 🔐

This project implements the **Caesar Cipher Algorithm** using Python.  
It was completed as part of my **Cybersecurity Internship** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 🔧 How It Works

- The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions.
- The script allows you to:
  - Encrypt a message
  - Decrypt a message
  - Customize the shift value

## 🚀 Tools Used

- Python 3
- Google Colab
